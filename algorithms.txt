preliminaries
---
1. dynammic programming methods
    - policy iteration [CHECK]
        - policy evaluation [CHECK]
        - policy improvement [CHECK]
    - value iteration 

2. monte carlo methods
    -

3. model-based rl methods
    - TD-learning (insofar as it requires a model to produce a policy)
    - prioritized sweeping

4. model-free rl methods
    - Q-learning (table, linear, neural net based)
    - SARSA (table, linear, neural net based)

5. misc
    - actor-critic

---
batch methods
---
1. batch Q-learing - i.e., Q-learning with experience replay and static target function
2. fitted Q-iteration (neural)
3. KADP
4. least squares policy iteration
